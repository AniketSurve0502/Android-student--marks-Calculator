# Student Marks Calculator

This is an app that I made as the final project for my Android Graphical Interface Programming class in Fall 2015. Go look at [Poll App](https://github.com/Maaat/poll-app) if you want to see something more recent that I made!

This app was made as part of a group project where 5 students each made an app and then packaged it into one app, but for this repo I only included the app that I made, which is why there's a navigation bar Activity that doesn't do any navigating.
